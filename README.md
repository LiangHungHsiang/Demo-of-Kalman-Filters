# Demo of Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter, and Gauss-hermite Kalman Filter
This repository provides a demonstration code of three Kalman Filter: Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter, and Gauss-hermite Kalman Filter. These filters are used to conduct data fusion with the pendulum model and the measurement model provided in the code. Please see more details from the markdowns in the code.
