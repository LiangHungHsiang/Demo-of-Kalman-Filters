# Demo of Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter, and Gauss-hermite Kalman Filter
The files in this repository are based on the course material of AE 567 taught by prof. Alex Gorodetsky. Author: Hung-Hsiang Liang.

This repository provides a demonstration code of three Kalman Filter: Extended Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter, and Gauss-hermite Kalman Filter. These filters are used to conduct data fusion with the pendulum model and the measurement model provided in the code. Please see more details from the markdowns in the code.
